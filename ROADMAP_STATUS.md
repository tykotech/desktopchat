# Development Roadmap Completion Status

Based on the roadmap outlined in @Design/Plan.md, here's the current status of each phase:

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure (1 Week)
**Status: ✅ Completed**

- ✅ Initialize Project: Set up a new Tauri project with the Deno backend and a React + Vite frontend
- ✅ Backend Scaffolding: Create the main Deno file structure, including directories for services, types, and utilities
- ✅ Settings Service: Implement the core SettingsService to handle loading and saving of configuration data from/to local JSON files
- ✅ Secure Credentials: Implement a SecretsService that uses the tauri-plugin-stronghold or a similar OS-level keychain solution to securely store user API keys
- ✅ API Client Factory: Create a generic API client factory for making authenticated requests to external services (LLMs, Qdrant, etc.)

## Phase 2: Settings Implementation (2 Weeks)
**Status: ⚠️ Partially Completed**

- ✅ UI Layout: Build the main settings page layout with a sidebar for navigation between the different sections
- ⚠️ Model Providers: Implement the UI and backend logic for adding, editing, and validating API keys for all specified LLM providers
  - Basic UI exists but needs full functionality
  - Backend supports OpenAI and Anthropic, needs all 12 providers
- ⚠️ Data & Web Search: Implement the Data settings page, including the Qdrant configuration. Implement the Web Search settings page, including the new Brave Search API option
  - Basic UI exists but needs full functionality
- ⚠️ General & Model Settings: Implement the remaining settings pages for general personalization (profile, language) and default model selection
  - Basic UI exists but needs full functionality
- ✅ About Page: Create the static "About" page

## Phase 3: File & Knowledge Base Management (2 Weeks)
**Status: ⚠️ Partially Completed**

- ⚠️ File Management UI: Build the /files page to list, upload, and delete user files
  - Basic UI exists but needs full file system integration
- ⚠️ Backend File Service: Implement the FileService to manage files on the local filesystem within the application's data directory
  - Basic implementation exists but needs full functionality
- ⚠️ Knowledge Base UI: Build the /knowledge page to create, view, and manage knowledge bases
  - Basic UI exists but needs full functionality
- ⚠️ File Processing Pipeline: In the backend, create the pipeline for:
  a. Parsing uploaded files (PDF, TXT, MD)
  b. Splitting text into chunks
  c. Generating embeddings via a configured LLM provider
  d. Indexing the chunks and their metadata into a Qdrant collection
  - Basic pipeline exists but PDF parsing is incomplete
  - Needs full LLM provider support

## Phase 4: Assistants & Chat (2 Weeks)
**Status: ⚠️ Partially Completed**

- ⚠️ Assistants UI: Build the /assistants page to create and manage assistants. An assistant is defined by its name, prompt, model, and associated knowledge bases
  - Basic UI exists but needs full functionality
- ⚠️ Chat UI: Develop the main chat interface component
  - Basic UI exists but needs full functionality
- ⚠️ RAG Pipeline: Implement the backend RAGService. When a user sends a message, it will:
  a. Generate an embedding for the user's query
  b. Query Qdrant for relevant documents from the assistant's knowledge bases
  c. Construct a final prompt including the user's query and the retrieved context
  d. Send the prompt to the configured LLM and stream the response back to the frontend
  - Basic pipeline exists but needs full integration

## Phase 5: Agents, Testing & Refinement (1 Week)
**Status: ❌ Not Started**

- ❌ Agents UI: Build the /agents page to display and manage the list of agents
- ❌ End-to-End Testing: Perform thorough testing of all application features, focusing on the Windows platform
- ❌ Bug Fixing & Polishing: Address any identified bugs, refine the UI/UX, and improve performance
- ❌ Build & Release: Prepare the application for its first release build

## Critical Missing Pieces

1. **Tauri Integration** - The application currently uses HTTP for communication between frontend and backend, but needs to be properly integrated with Tauri commands and events
2. **Full LLM Provider Support** - Only OpenAI and Anthropic are implemented, need all 12 providers
3. **PDF Parsing** - Currently returns placeholder text instead of parsing actual PDF content
4. **Complete Testing** - No comprehensive test suite exists
5. **Windows Optimization** - No specific Windows platform optimizations implemented
6. **Release Preparation** - No build or release process configured

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Fix Tauri Integration** - Replace HTTP communication with proper Tauri commands and events
2. **Implement Missing LLM Providers** - Add support for the remaining 10 LLM providers
3. **Complete PDF Parsing** - Integrate a proper PDF parsing library
4. **Implement Full File System Integration** - Enable actual file uploads and management
5. **Complete Settings Functionality** - Make all settings pages fully functional
